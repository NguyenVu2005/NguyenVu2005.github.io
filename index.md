Im a junior at LSU studying in Computer Science with a concentration in Software Engineering. What I love most about this field is that its always ever changing, meaning there's always something to learn everyday. Being able to build your vision from scratch and seeing it in practice is a feeling that never gets old. As of right now, my interest are leaning toward AI developement and Robotics as I find it facisnating how they can help turn tasks that used to be demanding to become more minimal.

# Projects

[Withdrawal](https://github.com/CSC-3380-Spring-2025/Team-27)  
*A 3D first person Horror Game built within Unreal Engine 5 using C++. The game contain classic horror elements like eerie sounds, dim lighting, and creaking movement all while the player tries to solve a set of puzzles to move on to the next level.*

[Coffee Shop Database](https://github.com/iwasella/aquarium-database-project)  
*A mock database built using SQLite and Python for a coffee shop establishment*

[Whirl](https://github.com/ghebert3/4330-Group-Project)  
*An app built using Figma, React Native, Expo Go, Supabase, SQL, and Javascript. The app help LSU students to find and make connections with others, serving as a space where reaching out first will feel easier when breaking the ice. Users can connect by a swiping system, book activities together, post memorable moments, and chat about all kind of things.*

[Real-Estate AI Prediction Model](https://github.com/AmyG-LSU/Final-4444)  
*An AI Model built with Python that allow users to predict home values within Louisiana for the next 10 years. The AI Model is trained using data from 2014-2024 for crime rate, school rating, median household income, home values, and interest rate for each parish within Louisiana. With an LSTM neural network and a gradient descent algorithm named Catboost, the AI model is tested on accuracy to ensure it can be used by future investors.*
